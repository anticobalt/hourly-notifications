# hourly-notifications
Set audio notifications that play in hourly intervals.

Written in Python 3.5.1; uses Tkinter, Pyglet, and Avbin. For Windows.
Requires both avbin.dll and folder named 'sounds' to be in the same folder as the source files.
Only .ogg files work right now, mostly because I haven't tested any other file types.
