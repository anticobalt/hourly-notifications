### Features
- Sets hourly alarms
- Plays mp3/ogg/flac/wav files
- Can change the number of minutes into an hour alarms play at (e.g. quarter past every hour, instead of on the hour)
- Reports playback errors
- In-program volume settings

### How to Use
1. Install Tkinter, Pyglet, and AVbin
2. After AVbin is installed, avbin.dll can be found in system32; copy and paste it into the program's folder
3. In the program's folder, make a folder named 'sounds'. This new folder should contain sounds you want to use

### Planned Features (in no particular order of priority)
- Allow user to choose where audio is stored
- Quickly set the same notification for multiple hours
- Setting to open program on Windows startup
- More basic alarms (e.g. play a sound every 15 minutes)
